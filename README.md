# __ArewaDS Project Assignment__
The repository contain a series of project as a requirement for completing python course under Arewa Data Science Fellowship.

## __Project 1__
The project discussed about data generating and visualization using python modules. The type of data plots and visualization is further divided into two methods. 
A. Line plots
1. Plotting a linear graph: This is use to visualize data in 2D frame using matplotlib. The mode data entry points is divided into two methods.
   i. Defining x and y data points separately 
   ii. Calculating the data values automatically using list        comprehension.
2. Plotting scatter plots: The same goes to the scatter plot as in linear plots. The data points can define automatically or by specifying the x and y data points.
This section further explains how to define custom colors and alos colormap.

B. Random Walk
This explores another module in python the _random_ modude to generate random walks. The project combines so many aspects covered during the python cohort 3. It includes declaring variables, if_statement, while loop and also prompting the user to enter something. Although the most important aspect here is the class and fuction as the class method. 
A separate class module was defined and was imported into another file for visualization purposes. The random walk plots were created and coloured accordingly.

C. Rolling of a Die: Die rolling program almost follows similar conventions with random walk. However, instead of using matplotlibs to visualize the data points, another python module called _pygal_ was imported and use. Different number od Dice was rolled ranging from six_sided, eight_sided, ten_sided up to fifteen Dice and the results were plotted and saved in __svg__ format
